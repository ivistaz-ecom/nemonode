Leaving with less than 1 (one) month’s notice will also entitle the seafarer to leave pay pro-rata, but he will be responsible for repatriation and relief expenses, with the employer reserving the right to recover costs incurred. If employment is terminated due to circumstances beyond the seafarer’s control, the employer will provide 1 (one) month’s notice or wages in lieu, plus leave pay on a pro-rata basis and free repatriation.

Following repatriation, sick pay applies as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: start;">
    <li>In case of sickness, up to 16 weeks after discharge with valid medical certification.</li>
    <li>In case of injury (not self-inflicted), for as long as medical attention is required or until a medical determination is made.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: start;">Seafarers must report to the manning agent for prompt medical attention upon repatriation. Failure to avail treatment may release the owner from liability. Satisfactory medical certificates, endorsed by the owner’s approved doctor, are required to prove entitlement to sick pay. If there is a disagreement, a third doctor may be jointly nominated by both parties, and their decision will be final.</p>
